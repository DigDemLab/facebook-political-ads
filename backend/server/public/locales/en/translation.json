Use this database to search for political ads based on who was meant to see them. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-are-monitoring-political-ads-on-facebook\">Methodology</a> | <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/political-ad-collector/\">Install the plugin →</a></p>",

Our software then separates the political ads from the non-political ones and shows them in a publicly available database. All of our code is <a href=\"https://github.com/propublica/facebook-political-ads\">available for scrutiny</a>. </p><p><br />The algorithm doesn’t rely on a pre-chosen list of keywords or advertisers; instead, it takes into account the advertiser, the ad’s text, and how it was targeted. It also relies on our participants' intuitive sense of what's political. They use a tool we wrote to identify which ads they consider political, and their choices inform our software’s subsequent decisions about which words, advertisers and targeting methods indicate that an ad is political. As such, we are, in a way, defining what counts as a political ad together with the community of participants in our project.</p> <p><br />The algorithm doesn’t rely on a pre-chosen list of keywords or advertisers; instead, it takes into account the advertiser, the ad’s text, and how it was targeted.

As such, we are, in a way, defining what counts as a political ad together with the community of participants in our project.</p> <p><br />The software lets us know how certain it is by assigning each ad a “political-ness” score. Sometimes the question of whether an ad is political is unambiguous. But sometimes, the software is uncertain about whether an ad is political or not. We show any ad that scores higher than 70 percent to users. </p><p><br />Ads from politicians running for office and interest groups advocating a specific policy are clearly political, so we aim to include as many of these ads in the Political Ad Collector as possible. We include some other ads that don’t fit into the first category but that discuss political issues, or that come from organizations that have previously run ads that are in our database, even if the newer ads themselves do not mention political issues.</p><p><br /> However, the presence of an ad from an organization in this list doesn’t mean that we categorically think an organization is attempting to influence the outcome of an election or explicitly expressing a specific policy preference.</p>  <p><br /> If you see an ad in the Facebook Political Ad Collector that you think we categorized incorrectly, don’t hesitate to let us know at politicalads@propublica.org. <a href=\"mailto:politicalads@propublica.org\">politicalads@propublica.org</a>.<p>",
